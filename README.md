This framework is made to work with an [XTB client](https://github.com/doruirimescu/XTBApi). However, you can implement your own platform's client and use it with [my wrapper](https://github.com/doruirimescu/python-trading/tree/master/Trading/live/client)

First step after cloning: `./install_requirements.sh`
