### A multi-tool trading, investing, and asset management platform
- Trading instruments (seamlessly connecting with XTB brokers)
- Stock monitoring and analysis (fusing data from different vendors, such as XTB, yahoo finance, alphaspread)
- Loan monitoring and analysis, for keeping track of your loans, as well as informed decision making between a loan an an investment
- Investment monitoring and analysis, for keeping track of your investments and other assets (precious metals)

This framework is made to work with an [XTB client](https://github.com/doruirimescu/XTBApi). However, you can implement your own platform's client and use it with [my wrapper](https://github.com/doruirimescu/python-trading/tree/master/Trading/live/client)

First step after cloning: `./install_requirements.sh`

Second step: read [this](https://github.com/doruirimescu/python-trading/tree/master/Trading/live/scripts#readme)
